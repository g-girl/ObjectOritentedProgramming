// Identifying classes from requirements
// Every project starts with words, such as specification, email, and such. 

// Analyse the Business Problem 
// 1) Represents business entities 
// 2) Define properties 
// 3) Define the methods

// A new customer management System
// Manage business, residential, government, and educator types of customers. 
// 1) Customer's Name (Last name, first name)
// 2) Email Address
// 3) Home and work address

// Manage both our current products and Consolidated System's products
// 1) Product name
// 2) Description
// 3) Current price

// Accept orders from customers either online or through our call center
// 1) Customer
// 2) Order date
// 3) Shipping address
// 4) Products and quantities ordered 

// Start with Nouns
// - Customer
// - Product
// - Order 
// In this case, each requirement identified one class

// Define Appropriate Members 
// Customer: name, email address, home address, work address; Validate(), Retrieve(), Save()
// Product: name, description, current price;  Validate(), Retrieve(), Save()
// Order: order date, shipping address;  Validate(), Retrieve(), Save()
// Order item: product, quantity;  Validate(), Retrieve(), Save()
// Always a good idea to take a moment and consider how time will affect your classes 


// Abstraction - focus on only of the important features of the class. 
// Encapsulation - a way to hide the data and implementation details within a class; no other code in the application needs to know about these details
